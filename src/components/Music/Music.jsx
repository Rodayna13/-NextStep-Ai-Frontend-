    he said he is working with mongodb and expressjs
    you asked have u ever worked with nest js
    he said that "i don't understand the question"
    you said  "NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and reliable server-side applications using TypeScript and JavaScript."
    he said "oh yes i have worked with it in a previous project and i liked it because of its modular architecture and dependency injection system"
    you said "great to hear that! how do you handle authentication and authorization in your applications?"
    he said "i usually use JWT tokens for authentication and role-based access control for authorization"
